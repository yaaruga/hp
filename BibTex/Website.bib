  abstract = {How can societies that welcome immigrants from around the world create civic cohesion and political community out of ethnic and racial diversity? This thought-provoking book is the first to provide a comparative perspective on how the United States and Canada encourage foreigners to become citizens. Based on vivid in-depth interviews with Portuguese immigrants and Vietnamese refugees in Boston and Toronto and on statistical analysis and documentary data, Becoming a Citizen shows that greater state support for settlement and an official government policy of multiculturalism in Canada increase citizenship acquisition and political participation among the foreign born. The United States, long a successful example of immigrant integration, today has greater problems incorporating newcomers into the polity. While many previous accounts suggest that differences in naturalization and political involvement stem from differences in immigrants' political skills and interests, Irene Bloemraad argues that foreigners' political incorporation is not just a question of the type of people countries receive, but also fundamentally of the reception given to them. She discusses the implications of her findings for other countries, including Australia and immigrant nations in Europe.},

Traditionally anchored in a particular geographic and political community, citizenship evokes notions of national identity, sovereignty, and state control, but these relationships are challenged by the scope and diversity of international migration. This review considers normative and empirical debates over citizenship and bridges an informal divide between European and North American literatures. We focus on citizenship within nation-states by discussing ethnic versus civic citizenship, multiculturalism, and assimilation. Going beyond nation-state boundaries, we also look at transnational, postnational, and dual citizenships. Throughout, we identify methodological and theoretical challenges in this field, noting the need for a more dynamic and comprehensive understanding of the inter-relationships between the dimensions of citizenship and immigration.},

Comparing and contrasting a small number of cases---meaningful, complex structures, institutions, collectives, and/or configurations of events---is a creative strategy of analytical elaboration through research design. As such, comparative migration studies are characterized by their research design and conceptual focus on cases, not by a particular type of data. I outline some reasons why scholars should engage in comparison and discuss some challenges in doing so. I survey major comparative strategies in migration research, including between groups, places, time periods, and institutions, and I highlight how decisions about case selection are part and parcel of theory-building and theory evaluation. Comparative research design involves a decision over what to compare---what is the general class of `cases' in a study---and how to compare, a choice about the comparative logics that drive the selection of specific cases.},

  abstract = {Across immigrant-receiving democracies, ``multiculturalism'' has come under assault by political decision-makers and commentators. The academic debate, while less fiery, is also heated. We start by outlining the multiple meanings of ``multiculturalism'': a term for demographic diversity; a political philosophy of equality or justice; a set of policies to recognize and accommodate ethno-racial and religious diversity; or a public discourse recognizing and valorizing pluralism. We then review the existing empirical literature and offer some new statistical analyses to assess what we know about the harm or benefits of multicultural policies, focusing on sociopolitical outcomes. We conclude that multicultural policies appear to have some modest positive effects on sociopolitical integration for first-generation immigrants and likely little direct effect, positive or negative, on those in the second generation. On the question of majority backlash, the limited scholarship is mixed; we speculate that multiculturalism works best in places where both minorities and majority residents see it as part of a common national project. We end by considering the conditions under which this happens and whether there are distinctions between ``Anglo-settler'' and other countries.},

  abstract = {We argue that scholars of immigrant integration should pay more attention to immigrants' `civic visibility' among local government officials, organisations and other residents. To document and analyse immigrants' civic visibility, we examine coverage of the Vietnamese and Indian communities in newspapers in San Jose, Boston, Vancouver and Toronto from 1985 to 2005. We ask (i) do local newspapers cover the lives of immigrants and their descendants and (ii) what explains variation in the amount of coverage devoted to different immigrant-origin communities in different places? We find little evidence that newspaper coverage is affected by the demographics of an area, newsroom factors or simplified models of the national political and discursive opportunity structures. Instead, we take an `embedded' context of reception approach, which takes seriously the intersection between general discursive opportunity structures on immigration and particular discourses about certain types of migrants. Our findings suggest the need to complicate national opportunity structure frameworks by considering how their interaction with specific immigrant communities produces between-country and between-group variation. Our results also underscore the importance of immigrant agency; greater visibility in local media appears to link with immigrants' greater presence in domestic politics.},

Is the rights "master" frame, used extensively by other US social movements, persuasive in making claims for noncitizens? If not, which other movement frames resonate with the public? We leverage survey experiments-largely the domain of political scientists and public opinion researchers-to examine how much human/citizenship rights, economics, and family framing contests shape Californians' views about legalization and immigrants' access to public benefits. We pay particular attention to how potentially distinct "publics," or subgroups, react, finding significant differences in frame resonance between groups distinguished by political ideology. However, alternative framings resonate with-at best-one political subgroup and, dauntingly, frames that resonate with one group sometimes alienate others. While activists and political theorists may hope that human rights appeals can expand American notions of membership, such a frame does not help the movement build support for legalization. Instead, the most expansive change in legalization attitudes occurs when framed as about family unity, but this holds only among self-reported conservatives. These findings underscore the challenges confronting the immigrant movement and the need to reevaluate the assumption that historically progressive rights language is effective for immigrant claims-making.},

Drawing on 54 in-depth interviews conducted over a 2-year period with 40 teenagers from Mexican-origin immigrant families living in the San Francisco Bay area, we find no evidence of widespread apathy or disengagement. Many youth participated in rallies on behalf of immigrant rights, and many were engaged in community groups, volunteer efforts, or even political action, irrespective of parents' status. However, youths' views on ``good citizenship'' did hint at community-level effects of illegality: Some young people have internalized a ``don't rock the boat'' notion of citizenship as staying out of trouble. At the same time, others redefined citizenship to include noncitizen parents. We conclude that the children of immigrants---especially those with unauthorized parents---face dual demands: There is pressure to ``stay out of trouble'' and stay quiet to protect their families, but these young people's birthright citizenship also provides rights and standing to make claims on behalf of family members lacking formal voice in the political system.},

A ``postnational'' or ``denationalized'' view holds that citizenship's saliency has decreased with the normative and legal extension of human rights and growth of more local or transnational identities. Others contend that citizenship is just a ``hollow promise'' of little substantive help to the disadvantaged. Surprisingly, the empirical evidence for citizenship's signi cance is thin, in part due to signi cant data and methodological challenges in identifying e ects. Nevertheless, existing research suggests that citizenship status may increase political and civic participation, carry economic bene ts, strengthen identi cation with the national community, and improve social integration. E ects are modest, however, though stronger for non-Western immigrants living in liberal democracies. Moving forward, researchers must investigate not just whether citizenship matters, but for whom, in what contexts, and why.

  abstract = {I advance a conceptual approach to citizenship as membership through claims-making. In this approach, citizenship is a relational process of making membership claims on polities, people and institutions, claims recognized or rejected within particular normative understandings of citizenship. Such a conceptual shift moves scholarship beyond typologizing---enumerating how citizenship is (or is not) about status, rights, participation and identity---to identifying the mechanisms through which claims on citizenship have power. This framework requires a relational approach and attention to dynamics of recognition within contexts of structured agency. Immigrants and their children can make claims to modify the normative content of citizenship, affect recognition evaluations and change the allocation of status and rights. But they are also constrained by legal structures, a society's institutional practices, and prevailing public perceptions. Citizenship as claims-making may require a reassessment of boundary approaches and a turn to metaphors of positionality, as well as more serious commitment to mixed-methods research. The stakes of understanding citizenship's power, as practice and status, are especially high right now. Yet based on existing scholarship, it is not entirely clear how much citizenship matters, in what ways, for whom, or why. This is the challenge for future scholarship.},

Concurrently, we have witnessed increased tensions around social citizenship, notably harsher judgments or boundaries over who ``deserves'' public assistance. Some have argued these phenomena are linked, with expanded, more diverse membership corroding solidarity and redistribution. We maintain that such a conclusion is premature and, especially, unsatisfactory: it fails to detail the processes--at multiple levels of analysis--behind tensions over membership and social citizenship. This essay draws on normative political theory, social psychology, cultural sociology, and political studies to build a layered explanatory framework that highlights the importance of individual feelings of group identity and threat for people's beliefs and actions; the significance of broader cultural repertoires and notions of national solidarity as a source and product of framing contests; and the diverse ways elites, power, and institutions affect notions of membership and deservingness.},

Chinese, Vietnamese and Mexican-origin parents and their citizen teenagers were asked what it means to be a good citizen and to be American. In discussing good citizenship, respondents underscored legal, moral, civic, and economic actions over ascriptive characteristics or political values. Their emphasis on citizenship acts illuminates how noncitizens, including undocumented residents, can claim membership through behaviours, even as inclusion may be contingent on being law-abiding, hard-working, or a good person. The term ``American'' is more ambiguous legally, but also more racially and economically fraught, including for citizens, as racialized tropes of illegality or cultural otherness affect those of Mexican or Asian origins, respectively. Membership markers are thus not simply about categorical placement inside or outside a boundary of ``citizen'' or ``American''. Rather, national membership can be felt as partial and gradient, positioned closer or further from multiple ideals.},

  abstract = {Much opposition to migration centers on worries that migrants are too culturally and socially different from the host population, that they will fail to integrate, or that they will change the demographics and culture of a destination society too dramatically. In both public and academic discourse, there is a tendency to assume that the ``problem'' of sociocultural integration is one of ``cultural distance,'' understood as an objective and measurable fact, and hence that the ``solution'' is to reduce cultural distance. This paper offers an alternative diagnosis and prescription. Whether an immigrant group is perceived as culturally close or culturally distant is not a product of objective differences. Rather, such perceptions arise out of complex boundary-making processes in which certain points of commonality and difference are highlighted while other points of similarity and difference are ignored or denied. These boundary-making processes are historically contingent, institutionally mediated, and politically constructed in ways that open up paths for certain immigrant groups while putting up barriers to others. The paper also argues that insofar as there are cultural differences, they are not always a ``problem'' for integration; successful integration does not require cultural assimilation or cultural convergence. There are a wide range of models of integration that involve various forms and combinations of cultural maintenance, cultural adaptation, and cultural convergence. The paper concludes by discussing a few strategies for improving migrant integration, including interpersonal interventions aimed at changing the attitudes and beliefs of members of destination societies, recasting national narratives to be more inclusive, and promoting policies or programs to enhance migrant minorities' ability to exercise political agency and voice.},

The study of citizenship in various non-Western contexts provides a distinctive lens through which we can analyze its contradictions. Rather than begin with the assumption that citizenship is universal, democratic, and inclusive, research in this area highlights how citizenship---as a legal status, symbol of national and/or ethnic identity, institution, and practice---is contingent. The chapter explores how technologies of citizenship create hierarchies of citizens and noncitizens that prioritize meso-level membership over individual rights, that extend beyond national boundaries, and that generate ``in-between'' statuses among both native and migrant populations.},

The proto-racialization of citizenship in Athens was followed by a more open Roman model. The racialization of religious bigotry did not become formalized until the creation of anti-Jewish and anti-Moorish policies in sixteenth century Iberia. Examining the historical record across diverse contexts suggests that jus sanguinis is not inherently racist. While in an abstract sense, jus soli might sustain a civic vision of nationality, in practice, the examples of Western Hemisphere states, particularly the United States, shows that jus soli is fully compatible with racialized citizenship. The construction of nation-states from empires is consonant with the racialization of policies while the consolidation of the nation-state system created barriers to racialization. Since the mid-twentieth century, citizenship has entered a deracializing phase, even as political entrepreneurs aggressively test the strength of anti-racist institutions.},

  abstract = {Abstract.               This article is an attempt to qualify existing evidence that increasing diversity is detrimental to a vibrant civil society. We focus specifically on immigration-generated diversity, and argue that while it may have negative effects on some specific civic and political outcomes in some contexts, these effects vary widely across advanced democracies. Our argument rests on analysis of a cross-national, cross-sectional time-series dataset that brings together individual-level World Values Survey data with country-level variables. With these data, we track within-country changes over time in trust and engagement. We show that immigration can have a negative effect on social trust, organizational membership and political engagement, but that institutional arrangements shape this relationship in systematic ways. In more economically equal societies and in more multicultural countries (where cultural minorities are recognized and accommodated), the negative effects of immigration on trust and engagement are mitigated or even reversed. We conclude that there is no general link between immigration-generated diversity and collective-mindedness. Rather, the direction and strength of the relationship depend on institutional and policy contexts.                                         R{\'e}sum{\'e}.               Cet article vise {\`a} nuancer les preuves existantes que la diversit{\'e} croissante porte pr{\'e}judice {\`a} une soci{\'e}t{\'e} civile dynamique. Nous nous concentrons particuli{\`e}rement sur la diversit{\'e} produite par l'immigration. Nous soutenons que m{\^e}me si elle peut exercer une influence n{\'e}gative sur quelques indices dans certains contextes, ces effets varient consid{\'e}rablement selon le pays examin{\'e} parmi les d{\'e}mocraties avanc{\'e}es. Notre argument repose sur l'analyse d'un ensemble de donn{\'e}es multinational, transversal et longitudinal qui rassemble des donn{\'e}es au niveau individuel du               World Values Survey               avec des variables au niveau des pays. Au moyen de ces donn{\'e}es, nous examinons les changements survenus {\`a} l'int{\'e}rieur des pays, au fil du temps, sur le plan de la confiance et de l'engagement. Nous montrons que l'immigration peut avoir un effet n{\'e}gatif sur la confiance sociale, l'adh{\'e}sion {\`a} des organisations et l'engagement politique, mais que les arrangements institutionnels influencent cette relation de mani{\`e}res syst{\'e}matiques.

Nous concluons qu'il n'y a aucun lien g{\'e}n{\'e}ral entre la diversit{\'e} produite par l'immigration et l'esprit collectif.

Drawing on in-depth interviews with 76 undergraduates attending elite universities and 72 teenaged citizen children of immigrants living in mostly lowincome households, we identify understudied economic narratives of Americanness: as future-oriented economic opportunities for elite undergraduates or stratified notions of current economic condition among immigrant-origin teens. We also find, depending on social location, that economic notions of Americanness overlap with other boundaries: whiteness for some immigrant-origin youth, and civic membership for elite undergraduates. Elite students place themselves at the centre of Americanness; immigrant-origin youth, even though they are U.S. citizens, sometimes place themselves outside these symbolic boundaries. Still, youth in more disadvantaged social locations sometimes appropriate markers of Americanness in strategies of what we call `defensive inclusion', employing symbolic boundaries of hard work, multiculturalism and birthplace to contest perceived social boundaries of race and class that might exclude them from the core of `Americanness'. Our findings suggest that researchers should include measures of economic national identity in future survey-based work and examine discursive practices of defensive inclusion in fieldwork.},

The large number of military spouses, espcially from Asia, pushed policymakers to revise their notions of racial admissibility, thus helping to establish family re-unification as the driving force behind immigration reform. Though unnoticed at the time, the combination of wartime service, patriotism, and marriage formed an inadvertent road map for the family-centric, and ultimately racially neutral, admissions policies that would dominate U.S. immigration law after 1965. The importance of Asian war brides in shaping the contours of U.S. policy stands in even stronger relief when compared to the relative unimportance of the issue in Canada, another major participant in World War II, which also pursued immigration reform during the 1960s.},

Among academics, heated theoretical debates exist over whether such policies foster or hinder immigrants' engagement with their adoptive nation. We provide a novel empirical assessment of this debate from the immigrant perspective. We ask how multicultural and citizenship policies influence immigrants' socio-political engagement with their adoptive nation in three realms: social inclusion, political inclusion, and political engagement. Using a variety of cross-national and single-country surveys, we show that multiculturalism in no case hinders engagement with society and government, and in many cases seems to foster it. Thus, the claim that multiculturalism undermines immigrants' socio-political integration appears largely without foundation.},

Yet, the conventional methods of statistics are not able to detect whether the hierarchy is consensual or not. In addition, the ranking of the hierarchy may be changeable among people with high East-Asian identification or different demographic characteristics. I analyse EASS 2008 data using Mokken scale analysis to overcome these problems. Results show that the hierarchies are consensual among samples of each country/region. In Japan and South Korea, the hierarchies are stable across subgroups, while in China and Taiwan, the hierarchies are influenced by personal characteristics.},

  abstract = {ソーシャルメディアにおける「世論」の特徴と、それを分析するメリットを検討するため、前号では2020年の安倍首相（当時）に関するツイートの分析を例として、「教師あり機械学習」によるセンチメント分析という手法を用いて、安倍首相に対する支持と不支持の態度を推定した。分析の結果、ツイートの8割近くが安倍首相に対するネガティブな態度を表していると分類され、世論調査の内閣支持率との間に、大きな乖離がみられることが明らかになった。そこで、前号で用いたのと同じ、安倍首相に関する500万のツイートについて、ツイートの話題を抽出できるトピックモデル分析という手法を用いて詳細に分析し、Twitter「世論」の特徴と、その有用性について報告する。 トピックモデルの手法は複数存在するが、本号では短文からなる文書の分析に適したギブスサンプリングディリクレ多項ミクスチャーモデル（GSDMM）を用いた。分析の結果、25のトピックが抽出され、全体の28％程度をコロナ関連のトピックが、24％程度を政治疑惑・スキャンダルに関するトピックが構成していた。トピックごとのセンチメントの分布をみると、ほとんどのトピックで安倍首相への否定的意見が大半を占めていたが、外交や「安倍首相への批判と、そうした批判者への批判」からなるトピック、辞任報道への反応では、肯定的意見も2割程度あった。また、政治的疑惑・スキャンダルに関するトピックは短期間の盛り上がりにとどまり、相対的に少数のアカウントが繰り返しツイートをする傾向にあるのに対し、新型コロナ関連のトピックは一定期間持続し、相対的に多くのアカウントが発言に参加していることも示された。 Twitter上の安倍首相への態度の大半を不支持が占めていたが、その内部は政治的疑惑・スキャンダルを中心に、相対的に少ないアカウントが積極的にリツイートを含めた発信を行うトピックと、緊急事態宣言やアベノマスクといった、多様なアカウントが否定的意見を表明したトピックが混在していたことがわかる。 Twitterデータの分析によって、通常の質問紙調査で測定できる「聞かれたから答える」意見とは異なり、人々が関心をもち、意見を表明するほどの熱意を持って抱く「世論」を測定することができる。本研究で用いたような、トピック分析やセンチメント分析などの手法を組み合わせて分析することで、人々の関心や熱意の推移、その多様性や状況による変化を検証することができる。このような点が、Twitterで世論を分析するメリットといえるだろう。 上記のように、Twitterに現れる「世論」は通常の世論調査から把握される「世論」とは質的に異なる。重要なのは、従来の世論調査から把握される世論とツイートの分析から把握される世論の、それぞれの特徴と利点、限界をふまえ、両者を補完的に用いることである。それにより、より多面的に世論を理解することができる。 ＊GSDMM（ギブスサンプリングディリクレ多項ミクスチャーモデル）Gibbs Sampling Dirichlet Multinomial Mixture},
